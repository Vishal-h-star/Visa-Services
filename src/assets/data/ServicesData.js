When we tested the Ultimaker 2 in our 2nd Ultimate Guide, we were even more impressed.<br />The Ultimaker 2 was created to be as easy to use as possible, letting you focus on creating and enjoying your prints instead of spending time tweaking and troubleshooting the machine. The printer features a bright OLED (organic light-emitting diode) screen which allows you to print files directly from an SD card, freeing up your computer to do other things. The glass-heated print bed accommodates ABS plastic printing (in addition to PLA filament) and the redesigned hot-end was designed with a smaller hot zone to reduce potential clogs and jams.Capable of printing from 30-300mm/s and up to a .02mm (20 micron) layer height, the Ultimaker 2 is the fastest, highest resolution FDM (fused-deposition modeling) printer on the market today.",
